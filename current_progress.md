# Current Progress and Next Steps

- Validated dispensing of mimic inks (including water tests with 25G pipettes) to form precise lines with tunable volumes via toolchanger dispenser swaps.
- Hardware includes three tools: liquid handling (for dispensing), UV curing, and camera inspection.
- Software: Web-based control via the electronic notebook[](https://github.com/htsrjdrouse/perovskite_arrays), integrated with Printer Designer[](http://htsresources.com:3100/) for layout, tip config, G-code building, and Shape Designer.
- Seeking lab partnership for real perovskite ink trials to assess photovoltaic performance, transparency metrics (e.g., AVT), and stability.

This work provides a foundation for scalable, low-cost fabrication of transparent nanosolar arrays, aligned with BIPV research on line-array patterning for balanced efficiency and transparency.
