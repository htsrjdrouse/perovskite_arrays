# Fabrication Workflow: 7-Step Perovskite Nanosolar Array Deposition

<br>

The device is built through a sequential 7-step deposition process on a flexible ITO-PET substrate. Each step uses the toolchanger system for precise dispensing (via interchangeable Luer lock needles/pipettes), UV curing (where applicable), and camera inspection.

<br>

Dispenser recommendations use standard gauge ranges (10G–34G available) based on mimic ink viscosity tests and line volume requirements.
