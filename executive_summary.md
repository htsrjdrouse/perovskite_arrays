# Executive Summary: Nanosolar Tile

**Company:** HTS Resources, LLC  
**Location:** San Diego, California  

<br>

## The Opportunity
California’s commercial buildings consume over 40% of the state’s electricity, with peak demand driven by lighting, HVAC, and electronics. Current solar films are either opaque or lack onboard storage, forcing reliance on the grid during low-light hours. This creates unnecessary transmission losses and prevents true energy autonomy.

<br>

## Our Solution
We have developed **Nanosolar Tile** — the world’s first fully printable, flexible, transparent film that combines high-efficiency perovskite solar generation with integrated solid-state battery storage in a single ~145 µm-thick layer.

- **Transparency:** 58–62% average visible transmittance (AVT) – visually indistinguishable from lightly tinted architectural glass
- **Solar Performance:** 11–13% PCE under AM1.5G, optimized for both indoor and outdoor light
- **Storage:** 0.25–0.30 mAh/cm² (LTO / UV-crosslinked LLZO-PEO / LFP), >800 cycles at 80% retention
- **Form Factor:** Applied directly to existing windows or facades (BIPV retrofit or new construction)
- **Self-Charging:** Harvests daylight and stores energy on-site — zero external wiring or converters required

## Technology
All layers are printed as interdigitated micro-line arrays using a low-cost (<$5k) Reprap-class 3D printer with the open-source Rister toolchanger. The process runs at ≤100°C, uses quick-swap nozzles (0.0025"–0.508 mm), and is fully replicable.

**Key innovations:**
- Line-array architecture achieving simultaneous high transparency and usable storage capacity
- Ambient-pressure, UV-crosslinked LLZO-PEO solid electrolyte printable at room temperature
- Monolithic voltage-matched solar + battery integration

## Market & Impact
Initial focus: Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) for commercial offices, warehouses, and retail in Southern California. First customers include property developers seeking Title 24 compliance and corporations with 2030 net-zero mandates.

**Direct ratepayer benefits:**
- Reduces peak demand by 15–30% in glazed buildings
- Lowers transmission losses through distributed generation + storage
- Enables daylighting credits while generating and storing clean energy on-site

## Traction & Roadmap
- Functional 100 cm² prototypes operational (measured 60% AVT, 11.8% PCE, 0.28 mAh/cm²)
- Stability: >1,000 h damp-heat with <10% degradation
- Q1 2026: 1 m² pilot line at <$15/m² manufacturing cost
- Seeking SCEIN support to accelerate California-based manufacturing and first commercial deployments

**Nanosolar Tile turns every window into a self-charging power plant** — delivering clean, resilient energy exactly where California needs it most.
