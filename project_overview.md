# Project Overview: Toolchanger 3D Printer for Transparent Perovskite Nanosolar Arrays

The core objective of this project is to develop an open-source toolchanger 3D printer capable of fabricating transparent, window-attached nanosolar arrays using perovskite materials as the photovoltaic absorber. These arrays are designed as thin, flexible films that can be applied directly to windows, glass facades, or other transparent surfaces, transforming ordinary glass into energy-generating, energy-storing surfaces.

The arrays harvest daylight to produce electricity, enable on-site energy storage (with potential future extension to integrated batteries), and reduce peak grid demand—all while maintaining high transparency for natural lighting and preserving aesthetics. This approach addresses key challenges in next-generation photovoltaics: scalable, low-cost manufacturing of semi-transparent solar devices suitable for widespread adoption.

## Primary Application: Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)
- **Target Use Case:** The film is applied directly to windows or building facades, turning them into active energy-harvesting surfaces without compromising views, daylighting, or architectural design.
- **Key Advantages:**
  - Line-array patterning enables both high transparency (allowing sufficient visible light transmission) and usable photovoltaic/storage capacity in a single monolithic device.
  - The entire stack is printed on low-cost (<$5k) open-source hardware with fully documented processes, making it accessible for research, prototyping, and small-scale production.
  - Projected manufacturing cost: < $15/m² at volume scale (based on material and process efficiencies; further reductions possible with optimization).
- **Future Extension:** If photovoltaic performance is validated, the system can be extended to print integrated energy storage (e.g., perovskite-based or hybrid batteries) for self-contained, on-site power solutions.

This work starts with safe mimic inks to validate hardware, dispensing, curing, and inspection workflows. It is positioned for collaboration with a local laboratory to transition to real (biohazardous) perovskite inks and precursors.
